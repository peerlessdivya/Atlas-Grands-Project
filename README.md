# 🏨 Atlas Grands – Business & Data Intelligence Project  

## 📌 Business Context
Atlas Grands is a luxury hospitality brand in India with multiple five-star hotels.  
They are losing market share and revenue due to strong competition and ineffective decision-making.  
This project provides **Business Intelligence & Data Analytics** insights to help them regain market share.

## 🎯 Objectives

## 📊 Key Insights

- High cancellations (~25%) reduce revenue realization  
- OTAs dominate bookings, leading to high dependency & commission costs  
- Some properties (e.g., Atliq Blu, Atliq Palace) perform well; others lag behind  

## 🚀 Recommendations
